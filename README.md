# primedConversionUI

Modulate_functions outline:
This branch is to allow testing and integration of the GUI to individual components.
The programmers can individually test: 
- Taking a before and after photo of the samples (pre and post)
- Executing green or red excitation
- Executing primed or photo conversion
- Displaying image analysis (note that this will only work when the corresponding pre and post photos have been taken)
