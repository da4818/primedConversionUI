# primedConversionUI

Our user interface has multiple aims. First, facilitate the operation of the platform. It needs to allow the user to turn on the LEDs simply, select the right filter for the operation, and take a picture of the sample while the excitation has been performed. Once a picture has been taken, the user interface is also used to analyse the image obtained. Hence, the user can easily know if the proteins tested are fluorescent, photoconvertible or primed-convertible.

For the interface, we used the Tkinter package (Tk intarface). It is built into the Python standard library which makes it even easier for the user. It can works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It is powerful, user-friendly and cross-platform, which is why we decided to use this framework.
