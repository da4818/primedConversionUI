#I wanted to create an arduino file that would turn the servo motor by 180Â°
#However, I know that to connect the python file, we need to have the arduino code running,
#But as it needs to turn only once when we press the button, it does not really work as the motor would
#turn as soon as the code would run
#I need to figure out a way where clinking "red excitation" button and "green excitation button
#would make the arduino code start.
